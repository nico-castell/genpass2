Description: Installs a command to generate very secure passwords from the command line.
 This is a replacement program for the Golang based genpass proyect.
 By using C++ and reading the file /dev/urandom directly, this
 program can achieve absurdly superior speeds when generating very
 large ammounts of random data.
