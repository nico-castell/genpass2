.SH NAME
.PP
genpass2 - Uses the device file /dev/urandom to genereate very secure
passwords.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]genpass2\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]genpass2\f[R] 20
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]genpass\f[R] reads as many characters as specified by the first
argument (8 characters if no arguments are passed) from /dev/urandom and
then processes all the data to turn the randomness into human readable
characters.
.SS Usage
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Standalone:\f[R] You can run it without arguments, and it will
default to an 8 character password, or you can specify the length as
follows:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  genpass2 16
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you input a negative number (such as \f[C]-128\f[R]), the program
will error and tell you that it\[cq]s not a valid number.
Any arguments after the first will be ignored.
The maximum number of characters the password can have is 4,294,967,296.
Why?
Because for every character in the password, we need a byte in memory.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Variable:\f[R] This is the recommended way.
You store the output in a variable, so the password never appears on
screen.
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  MY_PASS=$(genpass2 16)
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Clipboard:\f[R] You can also put the password in your clipboard
using the \f[C]xclip\f[R] command.
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  genpass2 16 | xclip -selection clipboard -i

.SH EXIT VALUES

Success
.TP
\f[B]1\f[R]
The first argument could not be parsed into a valid number.
Make sure the first number is between 0 and 4,293,967,296, without
letters or symbols (including \f[B]-\f[R]).
.TP
\f[B]2\f[R]
The program could not allocate enough memory for the password.
Make sure you have enough free memory; for every character you want to
generate, you\[cq]ll need a byte of free memory.
.TP
\f[B]3\f[R]
The program failed to open /dev/urandom.
Check that the file is enabled by the kernel.
.TP
\f[B]4\f[R]
The program failed to read from /dev/urandom.
Check that your user has permission to read from this file.
